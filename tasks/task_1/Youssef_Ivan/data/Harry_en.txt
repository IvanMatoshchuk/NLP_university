"The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided.",
"Harry saw Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last.",
"And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward.",
"Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing.",
"Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell.",
"One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air.",
"The fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him.",
"Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was over at last.",
"The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light.",
"Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration.",
"They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one.",
"He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. ...",
"They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him.",
"McGonagall had replaced the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House anymore",
"All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house- elves, and Firenze lay recovering in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth.",
"After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.",
"“I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she said.",
"“I’d love some,” he replied.",
"“I’ll distract them all,” she said.",
"“Use your Cloak.”",
"And before he could say a word she had cried, “Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window.",
"Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over himself, and got to his feet.",
"Now he could move through the Hall without interference.",
"He spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on her mother’s shoulder:",
"He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers.",
"Along the aisle between the tables he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention.",
"Everywhere he looked he saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.",
"“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between them.",
"“Will you come with me?”",
"They stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and Hermione left the Great Hall.",
"Great chunks were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains occurred every few steps as they climbed.",
"Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:",
"“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn’t it?” said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermione through.",
"Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps.",
"Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep.",
"But first he owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the truth.",
"Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their destination.",
"Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.",
"“Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle.",
"“Feel free,” groaned the statue.",
"They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator.",
"Harry pushed open the door at the top.",
"He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of Voldemort.",
"All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part!",
"But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair.",
"Tears were sliding down from behind the half- moon spectacles into the long silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm as phoenix song.",
"At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak.",
"He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose them with enormous care.",
"Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice.",
"“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped it in the forest.",
"“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious.",
"“A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you.",
"“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.",
"“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.",
"“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!”",
"“And then there’s this.”",
"Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see.",
"“I don’t want it,” said Harry.",
"“What?” said Ron loudly.",
"",“Are you mental?”
"“I know it’s powerful,” said Harry wearily.",
"“But I was happier with mine. So ...”",
"He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread of phoenix feather.",
"Hermione had said that they could not be repaired, that the damage was too severe.",
"All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would.",
"He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, “Reparo.”",
"As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end.",
"Harry knew that he had succeeded.",
"He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion.",
"“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration, “back where it came from.",
"Dumbledore nodded.",
"They smiled at each other.",
"“Are you sure?” said Ron.",
"There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.",
"“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly.",
"“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry.",
"“And quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, “I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.”",
"Nineteen years later Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year.",
"The morning of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air.",
"Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm.",
"“It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her.",
"“Two years,” sniffed Lily.",
"“I want to go now!”",
"The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten.",
"Albus’s voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car.",
“I won’t!"",
"“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.",
"“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger brother.",
"“There’s nothing wrong with that.",
"But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent.",
"The five Potters approached the barrier.",
"With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run.",
"A moment later, he had vanished.",
"“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother.",
"“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.",
"“Not every day,” said Albus quickly.",
"“James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.”",
"“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.",
"“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,” Harry put in.",
"“He likes a laugh, your brother.”",
"Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed.",
"As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came.",
"",Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express.
"Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared.",
"“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.",
"“Well find them,” said Ginny reassuringly.",
"But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces.",
"Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud.",
"Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. ...",
"“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly.",
"A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage.",
"Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.",
"I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it again.",
"He might be in Slytherin — ”",
"I won’t be in Slytherin!"",
"Let our contribution not be forgotten!"",
"Do you agree?"",
"Does anyone else know where it fell?"",
"It can stay there.",
"If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it?",
"The previous master will never have been defeated.",
"That’ll be the end of it.”",
"There would be time to talk later, hours and days and maybe years in which to talk.",
"We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one, And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!",
"But it was applause.",
