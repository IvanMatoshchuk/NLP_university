        "# sample from Pippi Longstocking.\n",
        "text = \"\"\"\n",
        "Way out at the end of a tiny little town was an old overgrown garden, and in the garden was an old house, and in the house lived Pippi Longstocking. She was nine years old, and she lived there all alone. She had no mother and no father, and that was of course very nice because there was no one to tell her to go to bed just when she was having the most fun, and no one who could make her take cod liver oil when she much preferred caramel candy.\n",
        "Once upon a time Pippi had had a father of whom she was extremely fond. Naturally she had had a mother too, but that was so long ago that Pippi didn't remember her at all. Her mother had died when Pippi was just a tiny baby and lay in a cradle and howled so that nobody could go anywhere near her. Pippi was sure that her mother was now up in Heaven, watching her little girl through a peephole in the sky, and Pippi often waved up at her and called, \"Don't you worry about me. I'll always come out on top.\"\n",
        "Pippi had not forgotten her father. He was a sea captain who sailed on the great ocean, and Pippi had sailed with him in his ship until one day her father was blown overboard in a storm and disappeared. But Pippi was absolutely certain that he would come back. She would never believe that he had drowned; she was sure he had floated until he landed on an island inhabited by cannibals. And she thought he had become the king of all the cannibals and went around with a golden crown on his head all day long.\n",
        "\"My papa is a cannibal king; it certainly isn't every child who has such a stylish papa,\" Pippi used to say with satisfaction. \"And as soon as my papa has built himself a boat he will come and get me, and I'll be a cannibal princess. Heigh- ho, won't that be exciting!\"\n",
        "Her father had bought the old house in the garden many years ago. He thought he would live there with Pippi when he grew old and couldn't sail the seas any longer. And then this annoying thing had to happen, that he was blown into the ocean, and while Pippi was waiting for him to come back she went straight home to Villa Villekulla. That was the name of the house. It stood there ready and waiting for her. One lovely summer evening she had said good-by to all the sailors on her father's boat. They were all fond of Pippi, and she of them.\n",
        "\"So long, boys.\" she said and kissed each one on the forehead. \"Don't you worry about me. I'll always come out on top.\"\n",
        "Two things she took with her from the ship: a little monkey whose name was Mr. Nilsson--he was a present from her father--and a big suitcase full of gold pieces. The sailors stood upon the deck and watched as long as they could see her. She walked straight ahead without looking back at all, with Mr. Nilsson on her shoulder and her suitcase in her hand.\n",
        "\"A remarkable child,\" said one of the sailors as Pippi disappeared in the distance.\n",
        "He was right. Pippi was indeed a remarkable child. The most remarkable thing about her was that she was so strong. She was so very strong that in the whole wide world there was not a single police officer as strong as she. Why, she could lift a whole horse if she wanted to! And she wanted to. She had a horse of her own that she had bought with one of her many gold pieces the day she came home to Villa Villekulla. She had always longed for a horse, and now here he was, living on the porch. When Pippi wanted to drink her afternoon coffee there, she simply lifted him down into the garden.\n",
        "Beside Villa Villekulla was another garden and another house. In that house lived a father and mother and two charming children, a boy and a girl. The boy's name was Tommy and the girl's Annika. They were good, well brought up, and obedient children. Tommy would never think of biting his nails, and he always did exactly what his mother told him to do. Annika never fussed when she didn't get her own way, and she always looked pretty in her little well- ironed cotton dresses; she took the greatest care not to get than dirty. Tommy and Annika played nicely with each other in their garden, but they had often wished for a playmate. While Pippi was still sailing on the ocean with her father, they often used to hang over the fence and say to each other, \"Isn't it silly that nobody ever moves into that house. Somebody ought to live there somebody with children.\"\n",
        "It soon became known throughout the little town that a nine-year-old girl was living all by herself in Villa Villekulla, and all the ladies and gentle-men in the town thought this would never do. All children must have someone to advise them, and all children must go to school to learn the multiplication tables. So the ladies and gentle-men decided that the little girl in Villa Villekulla must immediately be placed in a children's home.\n",
        "One lovely afternoon Pippi had invited Tommy and Annika over for afternoon coffee and pepparkakor. She had spread the party out on the front steps. It was so sunny and beautiful there, and the air was filled with the fragrance of the flowers in Pippi's garden. Mr. Nilsson climbed around on the porch railing, and every now and then the horse stuck out his head so that he'd be invited to have a cookie.\n",
        "\"Oh, isn't it glorious to be alive?\" said Pippi, stretching out her legs as far as she could reach.\n",
        "Just at that moment two police officers in full uniform came in through the gate.\n",
        "\"Hurray!\" said Pippi. \"This must be my lucky day too! Policemen are the very best things I know. Next to rhubarb pudding.\" And with her face beaming she went to meet them.\n",
        "\"Is this the girl who has moved into Villa Villekulla?\" asked one of the policemen.\n",
        "\"Quite the contrary,\" said Pippi. \"This is a tiny little auntie who lives on the third floor at the other end of the town.\"\n",
        "She said that only because she wanted to have a little fun with the policemen, but they didn't think it was funny at all.\n",
        "They said she shouldn't be such a smarty. And then they went on to tell her that some nice people in the town were arranging for her to get into a children's home.\n",
        "\"I already have a place in a children's home,\" said Pippi.\n",
        "\"What?\" asked one of the policemen. \"Has it been arranged already then? What children's home?\"\n",
        "\"This one,\" said Pippi haughtily. \"I am a child and this is my home: therefore it is a children's home, and I have room enough here, plenty of room.\n",
        "\"Dear child,\" said the policeman, smiling, \"you don't understand. You must get into a real children's home and have someone look after you.\"\n",
        "\"Is one allowed to bring horses to your children's home?\" asked Pippi.\n",
        "\"No, of course not,\" said the policeman. \"That's what I thought,\" said Pippi sadly.\n",
        "\"Well, what about monkeys?\" \"Of course not. You ought to realize that.\" \"\"\""
