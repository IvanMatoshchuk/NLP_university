1. present a creative solution to the event detection in a few single sentences in 1/3 pippi longstocking chapters (Rapha puts on github) by answering the 5 Wh questions.

2. count the number of separate events (location &v time &v protagonist &v object changes etc.) in 1/3 chapters

you can work alone or in a pair (not >2) but in any case will send me the code via email until next tuesday 13.00h!

plz apply the variety principle, i.e. work with different libraries (e.g., gimme5w.., allennlp, zalando, spacy etc.) and note, again, that I’m not expecting any error-free super benchmark boosting or so, just thorough and original approaches with good coding. we’ll all learn from the deficiencies discovered and thus generate ideas for better future solutions.
